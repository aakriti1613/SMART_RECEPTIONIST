# SMART_RECEPTIONIST
SMART RECEPTIONIST - JARVIS
This project integrates Face Recognition, Speech Recognition, and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to create a smart receptionist system. The system can recognize visitors' faces, respond to voice commands, and handle queries using machine learning and deep learning techniques.

FEATURES OF THE MODEL:
    1. Multimodal interaction (voice and face recognition)
    2. Process voice commands
    3. Real-time response to queries
    4. Multilingual support
    5. High face recognition accuracy
    6. Robust security mechanism to detect disguise

REQUIREMENTS:
To run this project, you'll need the following Python libraries and resources:
    pip install speechrecognition
    pip install pyttsx3
    pip install webbrowser
    pip install spacy
    pip install opencv-python
    pip install dlib
    pip install numpy
    pip install pandas
    pip install scikit-learn
    pip install winspeech

Additionally, download the following files:

    1. shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat
    2. dlib_face_recognition_resnet_model_v1.dat
Make sure to place these files in the correct directory for face recognition to function.

FILES:
    1. JARVIS.py: Main program for running the smart receptionist.
    2. user_data.json: Stores visitor data.
    3. live_facial_features.csv: Contains extracted facial features from live feed.
    4. shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat: Dlib model for facial landmark prediction.
    5. dlib_face_recognition_resnet_model_v1.dat: Dlib model for face recognition.

HOW TO RUN:
    1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
    2. Install the necessary dependencies.
    3. Download and place the required model files in the appropriate directory.
    4. Run JARVIS.py to start the system:
        python JARVIS.py
